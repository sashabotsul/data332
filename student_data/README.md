# Analysis of Student Data
<p> by: Sasha Botsul </p>

#### This page analyzes the student data in several different ways using majors, birth years, total cost, and balance due.

## Number of Student per Major
<img src= "number_of_students_per_major.png">
<p> -This bar chart depicts the number of students per major in a gradient fill. </p>
<p>-The majors with less students are a lighter blue, and those with more students are a darker shade of blue.</p>
<p>-The major with the most students, with 31, is Data Science. The major with the least students, with 15, is Bookkeeping.</p>

## Students per Birth Year
<img src= "birth_years1.png">

<p> -This bar chart depicts the number of students per birth year. </p>
<p> -The birth year with the most students, 7, is 2001. </p>
<p> -This data will serve a larger purpose in the next graph, showing majors by generation. </p>

## Majors by Generation

<p> -This stacked bar chart depicts the generational concentration within each major. </p>
<p> -For example, Millennials make up about 39% of the students in Data Science. </p>
<p> -Overall, Generation Z has the smallest population in this group of students. </p>

## Total Cost per Major

<p> -This stacked bar chart displays the total costs per major, segmenting by whether or not the student has a payment plan. </p>
<p> -Data Science has the greatest cost, which also accounts for it having the most students. </p>
<p> -Bookkeeping, based on the visual, has the smallest concentration of students with payment plans. </p>

## Balance Due by Major
<img src= "balance_due_by_major.png">

<p> -This bar chart displays the total balances due per major, segmenting by whether or not the student has a payment plan. </p>
<p> -Once again, Data Science is on top with the highest balance due. </p>
<p> -A lot of the students that have a remaining balance have a payment plan. </p>

## Comparing Total Cost and Balance Due by Major
<img src= "comparison.png">

<p> -This image shows a comparison of the total costs by major and balances due by major, both segmented by payment plans. </p>
<p> -Between the two graphs, the most notable shift is the concentration of students with payment plans. </p>
<p> -It is fair to interpret that the majority of students with remaining balances have a payment plan. </p>
